<h1>Submission Reminder App :books:</h1>
</div>

## Introduction
Imagine having a tool that will alert students about upcoming assignment deadlines; it sounds interesting. What if I told you that we made it? Let's go deep into it and how it works.

## Working‚õëÔ∏è

### 1. Structuring the entire application
We started by creating the structure of our application `submission_reminder_{yourName}` simulating the real-world application environment; by doing that, we made sure that it includes all necessary directories and files like `config`, `reminder.sh`, `functions.sh` and `startup.sh`as intend.

Down below is the structure of the whole application:

```
submission_reminder_{yourName}/
|
|______ app/
|        |___reminder.sh
|
|______ modules/
|        |___functions.sh
|
|______ assets/
|        |___submissions.txt
|
|______ config/
|        |___config.env
|
|______ startup.sh

```
**Note:** *{yourName}* stands for the name of anyone who's going to run the app; it can be me (Albert), Tella, John, and Whenever the app is being initiated, it will ask for that name, so that automatically it get that name as part of the application name.

So, based on the app structure, we can't go one by one creating the directories and files, which leads us to use `create_environment.sh` to create a structure for us.

### 2. How it works:
We created the file `startup.sh` to start the app when executed. Do you know about the logic? Let's talk about it based on the files.
- `reminder.sh`:
> The reminder file calls the source for using their intended functions and then runs init so we can know the assignment and the remaining days to submit it. Then, we parsed the `check_submissions` functions toward the submission file to find out who hadn't submitted the assignment by then.

- `function.sh`:
> The file which contains scripts to read the submission file and output the students who have not submitted so that our reminder can be triggered to remind them; here is how it accomplishes that:
>> - First, we have to skip the header and iterate through other lines of the submission file
>> - then we go through removing the whitespace and other leading
>> - And finally we go for checking the assignment that matches the status of `not submitted` and basing on the `config.venv` file the assignment we will be looking on is `Shell Navigation`.

- `submission.txt`:
> The main file contains the student records with the student's name, assignment, and status(whether they submitted it or not).

- `startup.sh`:
> As mentioned earlier, this file will help to run the `submission_reminder_app` in general and to accomplish that, we called all the functions from the previous files so that we can run the whole system with ease so here we used the `welcome'function from `startup.sh` itself, `reminder` function from `./app/reminder.sh` and then we go üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
